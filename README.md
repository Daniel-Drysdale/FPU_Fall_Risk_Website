# Fall Risk Prediction Website

## Overview:

This project is the visualization of the provided data from our sponsor, LRH. It exists to provide 3 main points of utility:

* Provide immediate integration with collected data due to both being in R
* Display data and provide path to request AvaSure Devices to Nurses
* Display data and provide a path for the Logistics team to assign devices based on a predictive model


## Basic Requirements:

* Create minimum 4 pages: Login Page, Nurse View Page, Logistics Team View Page, Request page
* Take in data collected from the data analysis team to display to Nurse and Logistics teams as needed
* Display data collected and transformed into useful predictive scores to the Logistics team
* Provide a secure login in for nurse and logistics members (status based on team)
* Provide a UI/UX experience that both younger and older employees are able to use effectively

## Description of Current Pages (WIP):

### Nurses:

Nurses will have access to a table of:
* Patient Rooms
* Name
* Fall Risk Score
* Notes about Patient

As well, they will have access to a request page linked onto the Nurse webpage via a button or other such means. 

### Logistics:

The logistics web-page is for the logistics team, in short, they will have access to everything Nurses do, but can manage devices.
